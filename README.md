An Android app to be used together with an XBee DigiMesh radio module.

It uses this library: https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial for USB serial communication to the XBee(For Android devices with USB Host capability)

It can also communicate as an USB Accessory (no USB Host required), but needs something like an Arduino Mega ADK to transfer messages between the app and the XBee
