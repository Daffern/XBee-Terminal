An Android app to be used together with an XBee DigiMesh radio module (Only tested with XBee-PRO DigiMesh 2.4).

It uses this library: https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial for USB serial communication with the XBee(For Android devices with USB Host capability)

It also implements USB accessory allowing it to connect to for example an Arduino Due which then acts as the serial converter to the XBee.
